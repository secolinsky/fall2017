I'm sharing my study notes from when I was studying statistics at San Diego Mesa Community College during the fall of 2017.
During that time, I was doing some self reflection on what matters to me and what I find important when finding employment.

The stats material is the beginning of my attempt to practice Donald Knuth's literate programming paradigm with GNU software tools
- emacs org mode
- org mode code blocks in R and python using Babel, and
- Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) add-on package for emacs

The main notes org file contains many curated links.  There are a few broken links that I'll clean later.

The repo has a weather report with routine stats analysis on the temperature distribution in El Salvador during the fall and winter
months of October, November, and December.

This repo includes my first attempt at defining a personal brand.  It also defines my Secolinsky persona in the form of a leaflet.  Included
is a leaflet folder that holds the LaTeX material I used to create my Secolinsky marketing material.
