* Summarizing Results
  How will my values translate into my ideal job?
  Because I enjoy the excitement in taking risk, I seek gaining experience from being an entrepreneuer starting my own business.  Influencing others
  comes from being recognized as an expert, and so I'd want to create a company with a chance of becoming an expert.  Also, I can have more control 
  in general in the direction of a company, and set my own hours if I start my own business.  This control also will allow me to define an aesthetically 
  pleasing environment in step with my company brand.  I value being respected for the creative work I do and feel that more opportunity to express my 
  creativity will come from creating my own company.
  
* Passion
  A positive emotional connection to our work -- often our most energy-consuming pursuit.
  - See passion as a nonnegotiable element of your career success.
  - Don't assume that any work activity that is associated with your passion will gratify you
  - Brainstorm more than one endeavor that energizes you
