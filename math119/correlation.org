* Hypothesis Test
Goal is to calculate correlation coefficient and do the following
hypothesis test
\[ H_{0}: \rho = 0; H_{1} \rho \neq 0\]
using the data below
| age | price |
|   5 |    85 |
|   4 |   103 |
|   6 |    70 |
|   5 |    82 |
|   5 |    89 |
|   5 |    98 |
|   6 |    66 |
|   6 |    95 |
|   2 |   169 |
|   7 |    70 |
|   7 |    48 |

From R we have that $\rho \approx -0.9804$ rounded to the fourth decimal place
and that the $p$-value \approx 0.00004882$.

For the linear regression model, we have that the y-intercept is 195.47
and the slope is -20.26.  To fit the model with the data, we use R to produce
the following graph:
